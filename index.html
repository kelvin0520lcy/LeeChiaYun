									<h1>About<br />
									Myself</h1>
									<p>
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images\PortfolioImage.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									I am an independent, hardworking and disciplined individuals who recently completed
									CAIE A-Level with excellent results. I previously completed my SPM in SMJK Sin Min and
									pursued my A-Level in Taylor's College, consistently demonstrating commitment in
									academic excellence and personal growth.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have a deep interested in mathematics and computer science, particularly programming. Since
									primary school, I had developed a skill in mental abacus through lessons and various competitions,
									achieving excellent results.  
								</p>
								<p>
									During my secondary school years at SMJK Sin Min, I participated in numerous mathematics competition
									such as Kangaroo Maths and IMONST in order to improve my mathematics skills. In addition, I had also 
									actively involved myself in extracurricular activities and served as the Head of Booth in my 
									Career Club during Form 5. While I am in this position, I had successfully
									led the club members in organizing and executing booth activities for various school event such as Sports Day
									and Charity Fair. I also regularly participated in SP Half Marathon, a charity run. 
								</p>
								<p>
									After completing SPM, I had self-learned Python due to its beginner-friendly nature and its importance
									for machine learning. To learn Python, I studied the fundamentals using the book Python Crash Course
									and supplemented my learning by watching YouTube tutorials to solve coding challenges.
									While learning, I also developed several simple Python projects to improve my understanding
									on the Python.
								</p>
								<p>
									To avoid wasting my time before A-Level, I worked as a store crew in 7-11 Convenience Store for four months. 
									This experience successfully improved my communication skills as I assisted customers with inquiries and provided
									information, such as locating products or suggesting medicine. Additionaly, I had developed the ability to
									work in team by collaborating with my colleague especially during a busy shifts. 
								</p>
								<p>
									During my A-Level studies, I had expanded my knowledge in programming and mathamatics by taking Computer Science and 
									Further Mathematics. As preparation for MCC 2024, I learned to code in C++, which allowed me to solve complex problems
									and strengthen my problem-solving skills. Beyond academics, I had completed various certifications from
									freeCodeCamp in Responsive Web Design, Data Analysis with Python and Machine Learning with Python during my leisure time. 
									These certifications had enriched my skills in programming.
